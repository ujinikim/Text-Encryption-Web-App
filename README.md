### Quick Start

 - Front End

```bash
cd ui

npm install

npm start
```

 - Back End

```bash
cd api

npm install

npm run build

npm start
```

### Testing

When running the frontend you can access the application running on port 3000 --> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Similarly the backend can also be tested as running on port 300 when using it independently from the frontend --> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To test the backend the following API endpoints can be called 

 - `/createUser`
 - `/checkUser`

Both of these deppend on having the local MongoDB instance configured and up and running. This is because the users that get created will be saved to the MongoDB instance.
